Candella is a fork of the [AliceOS framework](https://aliceos.app), a Ren'Py
framework that provides an operating environment to visual novels. This operating
environment includes utilities, classes, and other code that lets developers and
players write and use apps designed for the system.

## Differences between AliceOS

- **Release compatibility**: Candella's release cycle syncs up with feature releases
  of Unscripted and the Ren'Py SDK, respectively.
- **Responsive feedback**: AliceOS follows a release schedule and doesn't update as
  quickly with bug fixes or improvements, Candella gets feedback from the public as
  well as playtesters in the [Unscripted Playtesting Program][uvn-beta].
- **Targeted for Unscripted**: Candella will add new features and improvements that
  will be helpful for Unscripted, such as native support for the NadiaVM language.
- **Simplified app development**: Candella's application framework extensions make it
  easier to develop apps quickly without fiddling through delegate calls, and there's
  a curated project repository that players can download from and where developers
  can upload releases.

## Getting started

### Quick start: Get Candella

Unscripted comes bundled with the latest release of Candella and can be copied to any
Ren'Py project. In the game's files, copy the 'candella.rpa' archive to your Ren'Py
project.

You can additionally download a release from [the Releases page][releases], as well
as [download the project from Itch.io](https://marquiskurt.itch.io/candella).

### Build from source

#### Requirements

- [Ren'Py SDK][renpy] v7.4.8 or greater
- Python 3
- Pipenv

Clone the repository from GitHub, then run `pipenv install -d` in the root of the
project to fetch dependencies for making the project.

To build this project, open the Ren'Py Launcher, click "Distribute" and select
"Candella System Distributable". The resulting file will be in a ZIP archive with
`candella.rpa`.

#### Test-drive features

If you want to test out some of the features without building anything, clone the
repository and launch the project from the Ren'Py launcher.
